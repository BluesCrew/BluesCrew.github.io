          <h2>Basics – What is this game?</h2>
          <p>Blue’s Crew RPG is, well a RPG that is “split” between multiple things.<br>
            You can use it as a single player datapack or as a multiplayer one if you have a server.<br>
            You can also join <i>[Insert IP]</i> server to play it as an MMORPG.<br>
            It is more advanced here as we’re using a plugin <strong>AND</strong> a datapack.<br>
            The goal of this rpg is to totally revamp all vanilla Minecraft’s aspects.<br>
            (Combat, Mining, Chopping Trees, Exploration...)<br>
            and also adding more aspects.<br>
            We want players to almost <strong>NEVER</strong> get bored.</p>

        <div class="part" id="Main_lore">
          <h2>Main lore</h2>
          <p>Before telling the lore, take a look at the “Blue’s Realm” map, the world of our RPG:<br>
            <img src="assets/Map.png" alt="map"><br><br>
            When the hero(es) join the world, the world is already in a bad situation.<br>
            He(they) need(s) to remove this curse.<br>
            Soren, the Malevolent Giant, has Blue’s Realm under his influence.<br>
            He lives on his archipel, protected by a shield.<br>
            The hero(es) need to stop him.<br>
            Blue’s Realm is composed of 6 main islands and 3 less important islands.<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tollams Reef is where you start your adventure, it is a plain island, the most peaceful one.</li>
            <li>Valhesia is the second island, it is filled with mountains. It is said that mountains magically raise every year.</li>
              <li>Harenasia is the third island, the desert one. It is filled with sand and dunes. Be aware of quicksand.</li>
              <li>Vulcahala is the volcanic area. Long ago, here, the Mount Tilus, the biggest volcano of Blue’s Realm, erupted and burnt the island. The only trees are burnt. The only form of life are monsters that started adapting to this environment.</li>
              <li>Frigus Enclave is the fifth main island. Here, it is so cold that even fire monsters could burn. Even in summer, temperatures here can get to -30°Celcius. Wear a very thick fur coat or suffer consequences.</li>
              <li>Soren’s Archipel is the last island. Here lives the villain, the most horrific monster, Soren, the Malevolent Giant. He lives in his enormous castle, composed of multiple towers, big walls, and guards waiting for any enemy to come.</li>
              <li>Chalice Isles, Brighford Islet and Sceledrus’ Bay are the 3 side islands. Most villages and cities are built here, since no bane threatens these islands.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Soren has 5 Generals, that are ranked here from weaker 
            to stronger.<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Patetus, The Crazy Doom  <i>(Lives in Tollams Reef)</i></li>
            <li>Mons, The Lord of Darkness <i>(Lives in Valhesia)</i></li>
            <li>Cactaca, The Spiky Horror <i>(Lives in Harenasia)</i></li>
            <li>Vulcus, The Burnt Terror <i>(Lives in Vulcahala)</i></li>
            <li>Frigus, The Frozen Giant <i>(Lives in his Enclave)</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each island is under the influence of its living general.<br>
            Every now and then, they will cast powerful spells on the
            entire island, causing it to encounter a malevolent event
            for a short amount of time, modifying things in the 
            island, such as monsters, people, weather, and much 
            more.<br>
            They also put a gigantic magic shield around each 
            islands, preventing any entry or exit in or out of them.<br>
            When the hero(es) defeat(s) a general, the respective 
            island gets its magic shield removed, no malevolent 
            events can happen here anymore, and monsters become
            instantly less powerful.<br> Beating a general will also 
            weaken Soren’s shield.<br>
          </p>

        <div class="part" id="New_Exploration_System">
          <h2>Exploration</h2>
          <p>First, the map of this RPG is an Open 
            World <i>(4800 by 4800 blocks!)</i>.<br>
            That way, it’s very easy to add a lot of stuff.<br>
            Exploration is one of the aspects of this RPG:<br>
            Since the map is so big, it’s a very unique 
            way to travel. The map is always the same (Never gets 
            randomly generated). Although, most buildings or special little areas WILL be randomly generated. <i>(Mines, Secret 
              Passages, Houses...)</i><br>
            All these areas contains different things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Different Mobs</li>
            <li>Different Animals</li>
            <li>Different Background effects. <i>(Birds, 
              butterflies, etc...)</i></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Exploring is the main way to get geared up. You will find A LOT of secret areas, with chests, that you can loot. The rewards can be extremely helpful, so it is worth looking for them :D<br>
            While walking around, you’ll notice also 
            some bigger structures:<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Main Village <i>(Always in the center of the map)</i></li>
            <li>Small Houses with one or multiple NPCs selling stuff or giving you quests.</li>
            <li>Buildings Hiding hostile mobs. Beating all the mobs in this building will reward you for strong gear!</li>
            <li>Mines <i>(See <a href="#New_Resource_Gathering_System">MINING</a>)</i></li>
            <li>Small Forests.</li>
